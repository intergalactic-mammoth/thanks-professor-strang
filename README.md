## About

Professor Strang ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Strang), [website](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/)) delivered his [last lecture](https://www.youtube.com/live/lUUte2o2Sn8) on 15 May 2023 after a 61 year-long teaching service. I still remember the excitement and fascination I felt when I discovered his [MIT lectures on linear algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/).

I made a website where anyone can say thank you to Professor Strang for his teaching: [thankyouprofessor.com](https://thankyouprofessor.com).

## Notes for dev

### Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`).

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`. To deploy the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment. I use Node.

### Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/intergalactic-mammoth/thanks-professor-strang/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
